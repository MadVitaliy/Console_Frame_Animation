This project is very simple engine for console frame animation

It has realisation only for Windows, 
becouse I use Windows.h for optimisation.
For example I use SetCursor to print only not empty symbols
and decrease output time per frame.

You will have problem with printing 
big frames anyway due to console output.


Frames are read from .txt file.
Each frame should be saperated by '//'
(see example in bunny.txt)
